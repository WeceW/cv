  "p1": "Hi, it's Toni! A frontend-oriented fullstack developer and a very passionate coder. I have a strong visual mindset and an eye for details.",
  "p2": "My background is in printing industry where I worked for a decade before moved (and fell in love) with the software development. I've worked as a full-time developer close to three years now. My very first websites (html/css) I've made in late 90's, thought, so this stuff has been more or less hobby for me quite a while already.",
  "p3": "Frontend is my cup of tea, while backend stuff is something that I'm not too afraid to do anymore, yet I'm not getting the same satisfaction either. My weapons of choice would be Typescript (100%), React and Node (mostly used NestJS). Always open to learn new tech as well, of course.",
  "p4": "I enjoy my work the most when I'm able to lock myself into my cave and make the magic happen, but I'm not too afraid to open my mouth every now and then, e.g., for a demo session with a customer or when helping (or being helped by) colleagues.",
  "p5": "I'm a father of two and live in Tampere with my family."
